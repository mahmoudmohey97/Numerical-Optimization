# Numerical-Optimization
## This repo includes all assignments and practicals that was taken during Numerical Optimization course in ITI-AI PRO scholarship
## Notebooks are about implementing gradient descent variations from scratch.
## Greadient descent variations here:
### 1) Basic
### 2) Batch
### 3) Stochastic
### 4) NAG
### 5) Momentum
### 6) RMSProb
### 7) Adam
